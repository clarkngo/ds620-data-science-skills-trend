## 2025-10-27

- 2025-10-27T00:00:00Z — Added exploratory data review cells to `job_skill_analysis.ipynb`.
  - Summary: Appended a set of cells that perform dataset inspection using pandas: print shapes, display dtypes, run `.describe()` (numeric and include='all'), list unique values for categorical columns, per-feature summaries (value_counts/describe), and compute correlation matrix/heatmap for numeric features. Added plotting cells (histograms + boxplots) via matplotlib and seaborn.
  - Reason: Quick reproducible exploratory data analysis (EDA) to surface data shape, types, distributions, categories, outliers, and correlated features before any modeling or cleaning.

- 2025-10-27T00:10:00Z — Added explanatory markdown cells to `job_skill_analysis.ipynb`.
  - Summary: Inserted markdown explanations on how to interpret correlation coefficients (what values near 1.00, 0.00, -1.00 mean, practical thresholds, caveats) and on why/when to use histograms and boxplots (their strengths/limitations and complementary use).
  - Reason: Improve notebook readability and help future reviewers quickly interpret visualizations and statistics.

- 2025-10-27T00:15:00Z — Created documentation files `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` and `CODE_BREAKDOWN.md`.
  - Summary: `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` contains practical takeaways, cautions, and next-step recommendations; `CODE_BREAKDOWN.md` explains what each appended cell does and how to run them.
  - Reason: Provide discoverable context and maintainability for collaborators and future work.

How to record future changes

- When you commit and push, add a short entry here with the current ISO 8601 timestamp, a one-line summary, and 1-2 sentences describing the reason/context.
- Example entry:

  - 2025-10-27T16:48:00-07:00 — Fix CSV parsing bug in `job_skill_analysis.ipynb` when reading salaries.
    - Reason: Some salary values contained commas and were read as strings; cast to numeric after stripping punctuation to enable summary statistics and plotting.

Automating changelog updates (optional)

- You can maintain this file manually (recommended for clarity), or create a simple script that appends entries from your commit messages. Example approaches:
  1. Git hook (prepare-commit-msg or post-commit) that appends a formatted entry to `CHANGELOG.md` using `git log -1 --pretty=%B` for the commit message and `date --iso-8601=seconds` for timestamp.
  2. CI step that aggregates commit messages since last tag and writes them into `CHANGELOG.md` on release.

Keep entries concise and focused on intent and reason — this helps future you and collaborators understand why changes were made.
